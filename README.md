##### About this course:
In this class you’ll learn basic skills and concepts behind interactive news applications. What does that mean? Good question! A “news application” can be a lot of things. It could be a slideshow, an interactive map, a chart or or even just a story layout with interactive elements. We’ll cover all of those things and learn how to write code along the way.

We’ll also spend a lot of time talking about design and storytelling, and how best to serve our readers. We’ll dive into a few datasets and try to find the stories they tell. Where we go will be up to you as we attempt some good old-fashioned journalism over the course of the semester.

##### Course goals:
* Learn the skills to make things for the web, We’ll cover the holy trinity of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, how to save and manage your code with Git, and how to work with tools and libraries that help us make charts, maps and other cool things.
* Work together to find stories in data and learn how to apply it to web projects.
* Increase our collective vocabulary for design and interaction while exploring the relationship between content and readers for the web.
